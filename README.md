## What it does

This tool tracks pitch changes of a single instrument over time.
It can be useful for practising vocal intonation, guitar string bends, but it can also be used as a tuner.

## What it doesn't

It can't track multiple notes at once or even detect chords. It doesn't work if there is a lot of background noise.
